<main id="content">
<p>My name is Rachel Richardson, and I have genuinely loved pizza ever since I was old enough to eat it. Every time I travel for an extended period of time, I make an effort to try at least a slice of pizza from that area. And, since I have not had the chance to travel to many areas of the United States, I have also solicited pizza reviews from my closest friends and family. Each pizza is ranked on a scale of 1-10, based on overall taste, quality of the dough, and quality of the crust.</p><br>

<div>As a sort of quick-start guide, below you can learn about the most famous types of pizza.</div>
